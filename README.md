# Garage App (UI Prototype)

This repo contains a **web UI prototype** (React + Vite) for a mechanic booking flow:

- Home / Find Mechanic
- Mechanic Profile
- Booking Details & Schedule
- Live Tracking
- In-app Chat

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the Vite URL (typically `http://localhost:5173`).
